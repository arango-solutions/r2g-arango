"""Forward CSI v1 (Conceptual Schema Interchange) emitter.

r2g is the natural *forward* producer of ``CSI v1``: it knows both the source
relational schema *and* the ArangoDB collections it decided to create, so it can
emit a single document that pairs the conceptual model with its Arango physical
mapping. Downstream, the contextual-data-fabric M5 federated-query engine feeds
this bundle to the mapping adapters (CSI->R2RML for the Ontop relational leg,
CSI->MappingBundle for the ``arango-sparql-py`` AQL leg) so a conceptual SPARQL
query can be partitioned by source. See ``docs/PRD.md`` Phase 12 and
contextual-data-fabric ADR-0001 / implementation-plan WP-A1.

The reverse producer is ``arango-schema-analyzer`` (which reads an existing
Arango graph). Both write the *same* ``CSI v1`` contract — this module targets
``schemas/csi_v1.schema.json`` (a vendored copy of the analyzer's authoritative
schema; copy-now-converge-later).

The core entry point :func:`mapping_to_csi` is pure and deterministic (no
timestamps, no I/O) so its output is trivially testable; the CLI layer stamps
``generatedAt``.

    A CSI document scopes each property to its entity, but consumers that derive
    a flat vocabulary from the labels — a generated question language, say —
    cannot recover that scoping. Two entities emitting ``renewalDate`` make every
    question mentioning it ambiguous *by construction*, and nothing downstream can
    undo it because the distinction was discarded here, at extraction time.

    ``policy``:
        ``"qualify"``
            Rename **every** occurrence to ``<entity><Label>``. Blunt and wholly
            predictable; the historical default.
        ``"roles"``
            Classify each collision by the *role* of the column behind it, then
            apply the remedy that fits (see below).
        ``"warn"``
            Record only. ``"off"`` skips the check entirely.

    ``join_key_labels`` names conceptual labels that are declared **cross-source
    join keys** (P6.7, emitted as ``conceptualModel.joinKeys``). A join key is a
    *deliberately* shared label — the federation spine — so it is exempt from
    every policy: kept bare on every entity that carries it, and recorded as a
    ``"join_key"`` collision so the sharing stays visible. Qualifying it would
    rename the very label ``joinKeys`` references, yielding a CSI whose join key
    points at a property no entity still holds.

    Under ``qualify`` every occurrence is renamed, not just the second one, for
    two reasons: the result cannot depend on mapping insertion order, and leaving
    one entity holding the bare label would preserve exactly the false confidence
    this fixes — a consumer asking for "renewal date" would still be silently
    routed to whichever entity happened to come first.

    ``roles`` splits collisions that are *not* the same kind of problem:

    - **semantic** (every occurrence a plain column — ``renewalDate``, ``city``):
      genuinely ambiguous business attributes. Qualified exactly as above.
    - **identity** (every occurrence a primary key — ``id``): not N ambiguous
      attributes but each entity's identity, already carried by ``_key`` in the
      physical mapping. Dropped as a conceptual attribute, which *removes* the
      ambiguity rather than renaming it.
    - **reference** (a foreign key is involved — ``accountId``): the entity that
      owns the key keeps the bare label; the entities that merely *reference* it
      are qualified. ``Account`` keeps ``accountId``; ``Contact`` becomes
      ``contactAccountId`` — never ``accountAccountId``, which reads as a
      business attribute rather than a join and stutters.

    Qualification is cascade-checked under every policy: a rename that would
    itself collide with another label (``Account.id`` → ``accountId``, already
    taken by ``Account.accountId``) is refused, and that group is recorded
    ``unresolved`` rather than traded for a fresh ambiguity. Returns one record
    per collision; the caller surfaces them. Mutates the entities in place.

    The CSI schema cannot catch these. An entity object is declared
    ``additionalProperties: true`` (detection enrichments ride along as optional
    additive fields), so ``uniqueConstraints`` arrives as an unrecognised field
    and passes untouched however it is shaped. That schema is the analyzer's and
    r2g only vendors it — ``tests/test_csi.py`` asserts the copy does not drift —
    so r2g cannot add the field to it unilaterally. The check lives here instead,
    and runs against any CSI document r2g validates no matter who wrote it.

    Silence is the whole problem: a flat list or a misspelled property name is
    not a document that fails, it is a document whose declared uniqueness is
    wrong, and the first symptom is a downstream join that groups incorrectly —
    arbitrarily far from the typo.

    ``uniqueConstraints`` is a list of key *sets*, each set itself a list, because
    one key can span several properties and an entity can have several
    independent keys. Order carries no meaning anywhere. Names are conceptual
    property names (the entity's own ``properties``), never physical columns.

    An **absent** field means nobody declared uniqueness; an **empty** list means
    the entity was checked and genuinely has none. Both are legal, and they are
    not the same claim — neither is reported here.
